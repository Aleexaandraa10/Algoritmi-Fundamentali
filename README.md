# Fundamental Algorithms  

This repository presents an extensive implementation of fundamental graph algorithms, aiming to demonstrate an in-depth understanding of data structures, algorithms, and modern programming paradigms in C++. The project is part of the **Fundamental Algorithms** course and highlights my knowledge and skills in programming and solving complex problems.  

## Features  

The project includes a complete implementation of classes and functions for working with complex graphs, covering a wide range of classic algorithms and problems:

- **Graph Traversal**: Implementations for BFS and DFS, both iterative and recursive.  
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**:  
  - Dijkstra (weighted graphs)  
  - Bellman-Ford (graphs with positive, negative, or zero weights)  
  - Floyd-Warshall (all-pairs shortest paths)  
- **Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms**:  
  - Kruskal  
  - Prim  
- **Algorithms for Connected and Strongly Connected Components**:

## Technologies and Concepts Used  

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The `Graph` class is the core of this implementation and makes extensive use of OOP principles.  
- **Recursive and Iterative Functions**: Demonstrates versatility in implementing traversal algorithms.  
- **Greedy and Dynamic Programming Algorithms**: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Prim, Floyd-Warshall.  
- **Algorithms Based on Advanced Data Structures**: Heaps, priority queues, stacks, and other STL structures.  
- **Modular and Clear Design**: Functions are organized into categories, making the code easy to extend and reuse.  

## Purpose  

This code was developed as part of an academic evaluation but also serves as a demonstration of my ability to design and implement algorithms for complex graphs. It can serve as a foundation for more advanced projects or be used as an educational tool for learning both basic and advanced graph algorithms.
